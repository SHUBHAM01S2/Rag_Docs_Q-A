# RAG Document Q&A with Groq and Llama3  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for creating an interactive Q&A system. Using **Groq** and **Llama3**, it processes research papers, enables document embeddings, and answers user queries based on the loaded content. The application is built with **Streamlit** to provide a user-friendly interface.  

## Features  
- **Data Ingestion**: Load PDFs from a directory and process them for retrieval.  
- **Document Splitting**: Break down documents into smaller chunks for efficient vector storage.  
- **Vector Store**: Use **FAISS** to store document embeddings for fast retrieval.  
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions in a chat-like interface, and get accurate responses powered by **Groq Llama3-8b-8192**.  
- **Document Similarity Search**: View the context used to generate the response for better transparency.  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-document-qa.git  
   cd rag-document-qa  
   ```  

2. Set up a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows  
   ```  

3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Add environment variables:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:  
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key  
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key  
   ```  

5. Place your PDF files:  
   Add research papers or any document you want to process in the `research_papers` directory.

## Usage  

1. Start the Streamlit application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

2. Open the application in your browser:  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.  

3. Use the interface:  
   - Click **Document Embedding** to process and store your documents.  
   - Enter a query in the text box to ask questions based on the document content.  
   - View the document context used for generating the answers in the **Document Similarity Search** section.  

## Project Workflow  

1. **Load Data**: The application ingests documents (PDFs) using the `PyPDFDirectoryLoader`.  
2. **Split Text**: Documents are divided into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  
3. **Create Embeddings**: Text chunks are embedded using **OpenAIEmbeddings**.  
4. **Store Vectors**: Embedded chunks are stored in a **FAISS** vector store.  
5. **User Query**: User provides a query, which is processed through a **retrieval chain**.  
6. **Retrieve Answer**: The system retrieves the most relevant context and generates a response using **Llama3**.  

## Key Technologies  

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.  
- **LangChain**: For managing the document processing and retrieval workflows.  
- **FAISS**: For efficient vector storage and retrieval.  
- **Groq Llama3**: For generating accurate and context-based responses.  
- **OpenAI**: For embedding text into vector space.
